## EckeEcke.github.io
Hey there! 👋 
<br><br>
Even though I work fulltime as a Frontend Engineer, I still find some time to code on fun projects in my freetime 👨🏻‍💻 
<br>
EckeEcke.github.io serves as a hub to link and present some of my hobby projects. Feel free to enjoy a vast variety of web applications like the movie rating page Triggerscore or fun games created in Javascript like the turn based fighting game School Fight. Some of my projects are static pages. Others are hosted on different platforms like Vercel, Netlify or itch.io.
